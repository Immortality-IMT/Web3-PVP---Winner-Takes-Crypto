# Web3-PVP Winner Takes Crypto

PVP, stands for player versus player.

An Eth contract where two parties enter into a contract, they both put some amount of crypto in to play and depending on the outcome of the game, 
the winner takes all the crypto.

What is required?

The kiosk, where players are organized to play.
A player clicks on another player in a list.
Before game commence, a web3 contract is setup for the game, players ante into the game.
Wallets are deducted the ante of the game and locked into the contract.
They enter and play a game of skill, such as Street Fighter 2, Mortal Kombat or Tekkan style game.
The game registers the winner and executes the contract to send all the takings to the winner of the bout.

Here the sol contract is supplied.

The kiosk, the pre-game management, the game and outcome have not been developed.

Happy to take any codes to build such a system. Let's agree on an online version of Capcoms Street Fighter II as a proof of concept.
